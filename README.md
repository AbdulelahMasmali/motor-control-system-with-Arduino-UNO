# motor-control-system-with-Arduino-UNO
You are building a motor control system with Arduino UNO that:

1.Uses 2 DC motors controlled via an L293D motor driver(L298N is not available in Tinkercad but L293D works the same way for controlling 2 DC motors).

2.Shows the current movement on a 16Ã—2 LCD (forward, backward, rotating).

3.Performs a sequence of movements:

  Move forward for a set time

  Move backward for a set time

  Rotate left and right alternately for a set time

4.The LCD should show a live countdown during each movement.
